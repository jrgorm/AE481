Weekly Agenda

*Split into sub-groups:
Brian + Jason - Review wing code, will collaborate with Seth
Seth - Ramp up on AVL + CAD of wing (future)
John - Empennage, review all other code, updating GITHUB (forever!) and making transition to GITHUB smooth
Adam - Research what goes into CDR after PDR, no more CAD for few weeks
Joey - AVL

Notes:
Wing will be major design driver
Make design iterations of wing
Research multiple airfoil sections across wing
Think about raked wingtips for cruise benefits

CAD new wing every week or 3-5 iterations

Fuselage tube/interior design is FINALIZED

This week's assignment not huge so we focus on future work
such as XFOIL, AVL

EVERYONE PUT PERSONAL NOTEPAD LOG FILE ON GITHUB
no unified format yet, work description and date is fine

Remember we have a GIT repository now, please let John know when you make a
github account so he can add you as collaborator and edit files
