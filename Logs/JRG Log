Collated code from PDR submission:
	- Added Updated MM/D/YYYY Author: INI header to all files, please use this format when making changes to any scripts; make a new entries above previous update headers
  - Renamed parametersPDR.m to parameters.m and removed all references to parametersPDR.m in scripts
  - Deleted outdated dragpolar.m and will keep dragpolarPDR.m for the time being

Code edits:
	- Added fuel fractions to parameters
	- Uncommented useful portion of weightEstimation_initial.m
Investigated use of 4 engines; Climb TW/WS plot doesn't work with more than 2 engines

GIT repo edit:
	- Added Landing_Distance.m and TO_length_est.m, fuselage_sizing.m, empennage_sizing.m, MainWingSizing.m ...that should do it for old MATLAB files
Code edits: 
	- Added WingArea (with ft^2 and m^2, beware units) and b_w (m wingspan) to parameters file... It is needed for some codes to function. We need only them once for many calculations now
	- Edited TO_length_est.m, empennage_sizing.m, MainWingSizing.m for smooth operation

Code edits:
	- Added FuseD (m fuselage tube diameter), C_root (m wing root chord) to parameters file
	- FINISHED review of existing code and transition of code to github
Empennage research:
	- Must select tail volume coefficients for desired stability and controllability
	  High volume coefficient = More stable and less controllable
	  Low volume coefficient = Less stable and more controllable
