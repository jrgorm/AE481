Collated code from PDR submission:
	- Added Updated MM/D/YYYY Author: INI header to all files, please use this format when making changes to any scripts; make a new entries above previous update headers
  - Renamed parametersPDR.m to parameters.m and removed all references to parametersPDR.m in scripts
  - Deleted outdated dragpolar.m and will keep dragpolarPDR.m for the time being

Code edits:
	- Added fuel fractions to parameters
	- Uncommented useful portion of weightEstimation_initial.m
Investigated use of 4 engines; Climb TW/WS plot doesn't work with more than 2 engines

GIT repo edit:
	- Added Landing_Distance.m and TO_length_est.m, fuselage_sizing.m, empennage_sizing.m, MainWingSizing.m ...that should do it for old MATLAB files
Code edits: 
	- Added WingArea (with ft^2 and m^2, beware units) and b_w (m wingspan) to parameters file... It is needed for some codes to function. We need only them once for many calculations now
	- Edited TO_length_est.m, empennage_sizing.m, MainWingSizing.m for smooth operation

Code edits:
	- Added FuseD (m fuselage tube diameter), C_root (m wing root chord) to parameters file
	- FINISHED review of existing code and transition of code to github
Empennage research:
	- Must select tail volume coefficients for desired stability and controllability
	  Directly related to tail size
	  High volume coefficient = More stable and less controllable
	  Low volume coefficient = Less stable and more controllable
	  We need stability more than controllability, but we don't need a huge tail either
	  Basically our tail sizing depends on the volume coefficients and when we know more about stability of our aircraft
	  	we can tweak these coefficients to give different tail size
	  But the tail size is in the ballpark of 60 m^2 vertical and 100 m^2 horizontal

John - Code edits:
Busy with creating fuel weight/fraction code Fuel_Weight.m
Created new Parameters.m file
Github edits:
Moved all codes that have been worked on until today into Old-Code folder, all code written or updated  from this point will be in root folder (unless it is special code like optimizer)

John - Code edits:
Fleshed out rest of Fuel_Weight.m it should have most of the functions ready to run
Edited Parameters.m, there are a lot of unknowns for now
